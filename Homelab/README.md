# Overview
#### The goal of this project was to learn how to set up networks, connect services together, create websites and domains, as well as IT fundementals such as firewalls, HTTP/HTTPS, port forwarding, secure external access, and data security. To do this, I began by building a small, power-efficient pc that would allow me to self host a wide variety of services.  
### Current Hardware Setup
#### Main Proxmox Server
* AMD 9600x, 6-Core CPU
* 32 GB DDR5 RAM
* 2x 512 GB nvme drives for container and OS storage
* 2x 12 TB Enterprise harddrives in a mirrored setup for mass storage
